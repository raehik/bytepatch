Later extensions:

  * QuickCheck tests (would be very fun!)

Partly related:

  * Add `patch-dir` command that concatenates all `.bin.yaml` in a directory
    (recursively) and applies, then for `.text.yaml`. So no pain over patch
    ordering!
  * Add a few more docs in CLI (basic format explanations)
    * not too much & only facts, learner guide should be elsewhere
  * csv-patch: add switch to discard safety info when generating patch
  * patching: newtype for display-as-hex ints?
